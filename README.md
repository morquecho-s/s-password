# mini concepts

## Frames
> Are a visual set of email + password. So when we say in the code that we will add a frame on the screen it means that a frame will be added on the screen with the set of email plus password, and when we say that we will save a frame in the database we mean that this set of email plus password will be saved in the local database.


# Working tools
> I used the QT software called Designer to make the graphical window and customise it, as well as exporting the window to python code right there.
> If the .ui files have not been added to make changes in the graphical window, you can issue an issue to add them to the main branch.
